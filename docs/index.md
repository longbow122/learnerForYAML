Use the sidebar to find a specific topic to read up on, or simply get started by reading through each page! Most pages will have a small "practise" challenge which will make use of each lesson you were taught on that page! Feel free to have a try at them! If you don't feel like reading through the wiki, feel free to download the [original learnerForYAML file](https://github.com/longbow122/learnerForYAML/blob/main/Learner.yml). This file is a more condensed and less detailed version of the learnerForYAML wiki page, and the learnerForYAML website.

## Help
If you feel that these pages or the Learner.yml file did not help you, or you have a suggested addition to this website and the file, please contact me at my support discord: [https://discord.gg/bTfSaKn](https://discord.gg/bTfSaKn) I'll be happy to help you as much as I can there!

You can also create a [Github issue]https://github.com/longbow122/learnerForYAML/issues), and I will check over all issues on my GitHub daily.

## Prerequisites
When reading through this website, it will be assumed that you have the following:

- Basic understanding of computer science and programming (At a 7th grade, or year 7 level)
- A Minecraft Server (You should be working for or own one, this YAML guide will be as universal as possible, but most things with be Spigot relevant).
- A text edior (Preferably somethng that has YAML capability/built-in support)

This guide uses language that may not be understood by everybody. That is why it is assumed you have at least a semi-basic understanding of programming and computer science, if not, that's okay! Contact me (the original author of this wiki page) at my discord server or personally in my DMs. I'll help as best I can.

It is also assumed you own or work for a Minecraft server since this was made specifically with Minecraft server administrators in mind. If not, that's okay! You should be able to understand this YAML guide just fine.

If you don't have a text editor that doesn't have YAML capability, my personal recommendation is [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). It has auto-complete, easy automatic indenting, and great find functions! For most configurators and most plugins, this will be all you need. If you want something with a little more *pizzaz*, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a very powerful program and will do everything Notepad++ can and more. Some plugins have also made add-ons for Visual Studio Code, which will help you configure those plugins.

## Suggestions and Improvements
This website is always looking to expand! Do you have a suggestion or improvement you feel should be added to this website! Contact me on my [discord server](https://discord.gg/bTfSaKn) or make a [Github issue!](https://github.com/longbow122/learnerForYAML/issues/new) I will check both platforms regularly and will do my best to respond to these. If I feel your suggestion is something that is informative, and worth adding to the wiki, I will add you to the [wonderful wall of contributors!](https://github.com/longbow122/learnerForYAML/wiki#contributors)
